There is only one step required to convert your classic algorithm to be compatible with Alpha Streams, and this is to modify your algorithm to emit Insight objects at an appropriate time in your algorithm.
The default QCAlgorithm behavior is to emit Insights whenever a trade is placed, but manually emitting Insights allows you to inject information about the magnitude and confidence of the Insight, which adds value to the Alpha and can boost your overall score.

<h4>Call EmitInsights</h4>
<p>Insight direction generally lines up with what type of order you want to place -- Up/Buy, Down/Sell -- but <em>Flat</em> Insights are required for Liquidate statements. To emit Insights, you need to call the function before placing a trade. 
    Take care in setting the insight properties and don't emit insights superfluously or they could negatively affect your overall score.</p><div class="section-example-container"><pre class="csharp">

This information can provide value to your algorithm that goes beyond pure performance and is one of the benefits of manual Insight creation.</p>
