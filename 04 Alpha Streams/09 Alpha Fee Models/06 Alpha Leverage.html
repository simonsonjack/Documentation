  When a proprietary trading firm deposits margin with a prime brokerage they are offered 10-20x leverage to perform trading as long as they stay within target risk parameters. For this reason, control over "leverage" is always done by the institution and strategies are forced to use 1x leverage. If you require more buying power simply increase your starting portfolio allocation cash.
