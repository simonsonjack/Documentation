<p>Using a single line of code you can set all of the reality models required for an Alpha Stream. This is done via a Brokerage Model. The brokerage model sets all your asset fee, slippage and margin models to the required settings automatically. This should be called in your <code>Initialize()</code> method.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python"># Set fee, slippage and margin models automatically.
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.AlphaStreams)</pre>
<pre class="csharp">//Set fee, slippage and margin models automatically.
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.AlphaStreams);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Behind the scenes this sets your models to the <code>AlphaStreamsBrokerageModel</code>, <code>AlphaStreamsFeeModel</code>, and <code>AlphaStreamsSlippageModel</code>. In the following sections we'll explore these models in more detail.
