    One question every Alpha author must be able to answer is why people should invest in their strategy. Active 
    trading involves commission costs, borrowing costs, and other risks. The signal that the algorithm finds in the data needs to be unique and provide sufficient Alpha to warrant the extra
    risk. If the strategy produces an equity curve that is too correlated with a relevant benchmark, then it is likely cheaper and safer for an investor to just 
    buy the benchmark. Be sure to compare the strategy against common benchmarks to see how much additional value it produces beyond the broader market returns.
