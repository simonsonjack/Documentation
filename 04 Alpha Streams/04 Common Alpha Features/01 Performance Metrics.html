<h4>Sharpe Ratio</h4>
<p>
    The Sharpe ratio is likely the most common performance measurement as it conveys much information very quickly. Despite its limitations, a number expressing
    risk-adjusted performance is a valuable tool that investors use to screen algorithms. Sharpe ratios need to be positive, but a good minimum to aim for is an annualized Sharpe 
    ratio of 1.

<h4>Maximum Drawdown</h4>
<p>
    Drawdown is the total decline from a strategy's maximum value to its lowest value over a specified period. It is a good measure of risk and performance 
    and is something that is closely scrutinized by investors. Algorithms with consistent returns and low drawdown are more likely to provide value to investors than a strategy 
    with higher overall returns and a significant drawdown, which demonstrates higher strategy risk and volatility.
</p>
<h4>Time Underwater</h4>
<p>
    Time underwater is the amount of time that a strategy is in a drawdown. That is, the amount of time a strategy spends below its peak value before recovering. 
    Short time underwater demonstrates resilience and adaptability, reassuring investors that anytime spent underwater is likely be short-lived and that losses will be recovered.
</p>
<h4>Long-Short Ratio</h4>
<p>
    Due to borrowing costs, funds often want to be dollar-neutral in their strategies. A strategy that achieves this helps offset the cost of trading on margin and reduces exposure risk. Not 
    all strategies need to be market-neutral, but it is a feature that is common among high-value Alphas.
