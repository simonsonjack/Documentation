    There is no hard upper or lower limit to the frequency of trading, but there are a few key considerations to keep in mind. Many funds are 
    prop firms that prefer to trade on an intra-day or daily basis, and they might be looking for Alphas that
    <ul>
        <li>Place a few trades in the same day and end the day in cash</li>
        <li>Maintain an even long/short ratio to balance out borrowing costs</li>
        <li>Place trades daily or intraday and only hold positions for a few days at most</li>
        <li>Re-balance weekly at most</li>
    </ul>
    Larger institutional investment firms might be looking for Alphas that
    <ul>
        <li>Do not trade intraday</li>
        <li>Rebalance weekly or longer</li>
        <li>Are long-only</li>
        <li>Minimize trading frequency to keep costs low</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
        This is not an exhaustive list, but there are a lot of practical limitations that different funds experience and investment styles to consider
        when building your models.
