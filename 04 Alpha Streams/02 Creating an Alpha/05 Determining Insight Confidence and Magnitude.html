To maximize the compatibility and use of an Alpha Model, it should populate as many fields as possible. As the author, you should put 
some thought into the abstract, relatively artistic properties of an Insight.
</p>
<h4>Insight Period</h4>
<p>
    How long do you expect the signal to last? Can you use any information from the data you're consuming to build a theory 
    on the Insight timeframe? Although tricky questions with some creative thought you can likely estimate this field. 
    High-frequency strategies generate short insights, where foundational moves in the economy produce much longer predictions.
</p>
<h4>Insight Magnitude</h4>
<p>
    What is the expected return from your Insight? Will this data cause a large change in the asset price within the time-frame 
    you are specifying? The Insight magnitude indicates how tradable the signal is for the Fund. The price movement, 
    combined with the asset volume give the depth of the signal and an estimate of how much capital can be deployed to your Alpha.
</p>
<h4>Insight Confidence</h4>
<p>
    How strong is your signal? Some Portfolio Construction techniques such as Black Litterman allow using the confidence 
    of the signal as a factor in the allocation. When applicable include Confidence in your Alpha Model, this way consumers 
    can factor in this into their decision.
</p>
<h4>Insight Weight</h4>
<p>
    How significant is the signal? Assigning an Insight a weight can tell a Portfolio Construction Model, such as the Insight 
    Weighting Portfolio Construction Model, can determine position sizes based on the significance of the Insight. Weighting Insights allows
    the model to convey information about which predictions should be valued highest by consumers, which is especially important 
    if the consumer can't act on every Insight generated.
