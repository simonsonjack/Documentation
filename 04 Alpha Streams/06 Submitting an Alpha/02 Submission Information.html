Alpha submissions provide some information funds can use to help them license your strategy. Start by giving your strategy an appropriate name for the Alpha, along with a description of the Alpha strategy. Most Alphas are relatively simple, so a sentence or two is fine here. Alpha pricing is covered in the <a href="/docs/alpha-streams/pricing-an-alpha">Pricing an Alpha</a> section.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.quantconnect.com/docs/i/alpha-dashboard-description.png"> <br><p>Don't worry too much about making this perfect; you can update these fields later as your Alpha improves.</p><p>From there you should select an icon to represent the Alpha, along with your project and the backtest with the code snapshot you are submitting. For funds to consume the Alphas, they must generate Insight objects, so only Framework or Upgraded Classic algorithms are supported.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/docs/i/alpha-dashboard-icons.png"/><p>Submitted Alphas require a short review process to ensure they are technically sound and follow the community guidelines.
