Alphas submitted to be licensed are hosted live in QuantConnect's production environment for free by QuantConnect. Their insights are recorded in real-time and timestamped to the millisecond.
</p><p>To get an Alpha listed we ask for information about the author; along with meta information about the strategy itself such as a description of its focus. This information will be consumed by marketplace participants to determine whether to license an Alpha.</p><p>Once the Alpha is approved and deployed it begins the process of generating a live track record. Insights generated out of sample are marked as such and displayed separately in the marketplace.</p><p>To get started; navigate to your <a href="/alpha/dashboard">fund dashboard</a> to submit an Alpha.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/docs/i/alpha-dashboard.png" />
