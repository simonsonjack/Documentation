<p>
Alphas are reviewed for seven <b>technical</b> criteria. We aim to not impose any value bias during an Alpha review but primarily to ensure they are mechanically sound. 
When submitting your Alpha please review it for the following points:
</p>
<h4>Stateless &amp; Resilient</h4>
<p>Mechanisms should be set up to restore internal state in the event of reboots. 
    Alphas will be very long running. Over the course of months or years, the server will need patches and occasional restarting. The alpha should be smart enough to automatically recover in the
     event of restart using History and WarmUp API methods.
</p>
<h4>Use Reliable Data Sources</h4>
<p>Alphas should use public data, commercial feeds or QuantConnect's data. Importing a personal dataset through DropBox isn't reliable enough to build a long-term track record and ensure the Alpha will continue working as expected. 
    You should use public data sources (e.g. Quandl), commercial data, or QuantConnect supplied data.
</p>
<h4>Grounded in Reality</h4>
<p>Alphas should have clear strategic reasoning underpinning the strategy. A single reason based foundation for the algorithm is necessary to understand the alpha behavior when things go wrong, 
    and it helps improve your alpha application for funds. Obscure correlations or overfitted strategies tend to perform poorly out of sample.
</p>
<h4>Transparent Sourcing</h4>
<p>Authors need a transparent employment history and alphas must not infringe on other IP. We'd like to know the employment history of authors on the platform and ensure the alpha is not infringing
     on any intellectual property, including your current and past employers. Public or shared content may be used as a foundation and extended. Where you may have licensed the IP from a third party,
      presenting consents for usage are acceptable.
</p>
<h4>Edge Case Handling</h4>
<p>
Alphas need to be able to handle edge cases such as Dividends, Splits, and Delistings. This adds another layer of resiliency and will keep an Alpha running in the event of data changes. This can involve simple control logic, explicitly removing certain affected securities from the Universe, or other methods.
</p>
<h4>Recommended Best Practices</h4>
<p>We won't reject any Alphas based on what is outlined below, but these are good practices to abide by when authoring an Alpha.</p>
<h5>Avoid Look-Ahead Bias</h5>
<p>
Look-ahead bias can negatively affect the performance of an Alpha once it is deployed and will limit its appeal for licensing. Bias is introduced by using information or data in testing that would not have been known or
available during the period being analyzed. In order to avoid look-ahead bias in an Alpha, it is vital only to use information that would have been available at the time of the trade.
</p>
<h5>Limit Selection Bias</h5>
<p>
Selection bias happens when an Alpha selects specific securities where the data is known and where a subset of the data is systematically excluded due to a particular attribute. Universe Selection aids in preventing
selection bias by blindly choosing assets with limited filtering and without foreknowledge of whether the security will be delisted, declare bankruptcy, split, etc. Fixed universes are not necessarily biased, but authors must exercise caution. Alphas
whose Ingiths are generalizable across groups of securities and market conditions will generate more appeal than those with minimal scope.
</p>

<h5>Reality Modelling</h5>
<p>
QuantConnect offers extensive API to model different market/brokerage conditions for individual traders or researchers, but funds have specific methods and models they'll want to use in replicating backtests and in their live trading.
To ensure uniformity and maximum compatibility, we've implemented an Alpha Streams Brokerage Model that incorporates a most of the common fees and restrictions that funds face in trading. This model should be used for all Alpha Streams submissions.</p>
