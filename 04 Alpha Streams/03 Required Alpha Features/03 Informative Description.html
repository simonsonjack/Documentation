    Investors want to understand the basic ideas behind the signals they are receiving. Backtests and performance metrics are significant and can convey a lot of
    information about a strategy, but the best way to sell your Alpha is to give an informative, comprehensive summary involving the basic premise, 
    risk-management methods, order management, universe selection, etc. A thorough description gives funds more information and demonstrates that 
    you are a well-informed developer, which can help establish trust between yourself and the funds looking to invest.
